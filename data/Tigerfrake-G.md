# [G-01] Switching between 1 and 2 instead of 0 and 1 (or false and true) is more gas efficient. 

### Description:
`SSTORE` from 0 to 1 (or any non-zero value) costs 20000 gas. `SSTORE` from 1 to 2 (or any other non-zero value) costs 5000 gas.
By storing the original value once again, a refund is triggered ( https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200).
Since refunds are capped to a percentage of the total transactionâ€™s gas, it is best to keep them low, to increase the likelihood of the full refund coming into effect.
Therefore, switching between 1, 2 instead of 0, 1 will be more gas efficient.
