# Centralization Risks

Centralization risks pose significant concerns in decentralized finance ecosystems, as they undermine the core principles of decentralization, transparency, and censorship resistance. Within the protocol's codebase, several contracts exhibit centralization risks due to dependencies on external contracts, lack of robust access control mechanisms, and reliance on owner-controlled functions.

1. **PoolStats.sol**: The dependency on external contracts (`exchangeConfig`, `poolsConfig`) without robust access control mechanisms introduces centralization risks. If these external contracts are compromised or manipulated, it could impact the integrity of arbitrage profit tracking and distribution.

2. **RewardsEmitter.sol**: The lack of explicit access control for adding rewards may lead to unauthorized access and centralization vulnerabilities. Without proper access control mechanisms, malicious actors could manipulate reward distributions, leading to unfair advantages or economic distortions.

3. **StableConfig.sol**: The reliance on owner-controlled modification functions introduces centralization risks if the owner account is compromised. Malicious actors gaining control of the owner account could manipulate configuration parameters, impacting the stability and functionality of the stablecoin system.

4. **CollateralAndLiquidity.sol**: Dependency on external contracts for critical functionalities raises concerns about centralization and security. Any vulnerabilities or compromises in these external contracts could potentially impact the security and stability of collateral management and liquidity provision within the protocol.

To mitigate centralization risks, the protocol should prioritize decentralization efforts, implement robust access control mechanisms, conduct thorough audits of external dependencies, and explore options for distributing control and governance among multiple entities or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
